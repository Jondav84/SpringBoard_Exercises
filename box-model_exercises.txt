 1. Box Model: a design tool used to create the design and layout of a web page.
it is a container with 4 properties; border, margin, padding, and the content.

2. The difference between margin and padding: margin is the space between elements
padding is the space between the content of the element and the border of the element.

3. Margin collapsing: when 2 vertical margins contact one another the larger
of the 2 margins will overlap the smaller leaving one margin, the larger one.

4. Box sizing: allows us to set the entire element's size so that the added border
and padding do not interfere with the other elements. (properties stay w/i the set size of the box)

5. Outline: a line around the elements,outside the borders, used do make an element stand out.
typically used with a hover/focus effect to help draw attention to the area.

6. Add a background image syntax:
p (element to modify) {background-image:url("either a direct file path to img, or a link to internet image")}

7. Given a div w/ a width of 200px, margin of 20px, and padding of 20px what is the calculated width by the browser?
200px element + 20px padding left + 20px padding right = 240px total size. (margin is not calculated)

8. Given a div w/ a height of 100px, border of 10px, and padding of 20px what is the calculated height by the browser?
100px element + 10px border top + 10px border bottom + 20px padding top+ 20px padding bottom = 160px total height.

9. Margin:auto: horizontally center and element w/i its container. element takes up specified width,
then splits the rest of the space equally between the left and right sides of the margin.
