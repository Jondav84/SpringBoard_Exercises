Boolean logic exercises

Part 1:
True				
True
1
True
False
True
True

Part 2:
A:
“Keep it Up”

By not entering in the comparison operator the expression will automatically check to see if the value is “truthy” or “falsy”. 
B:
“Third”, it will be the first expression to be evaluated true
Undefined
No, undefined is inherently a falsy value.
No, it is an empty string which has an inherently falsy value.
Yes, by having a defined value it is inherently truthy.

Part 3:
If (Math.random() > 0.5) {
	    console.log(“Over 0.5”)
	}  else {
	    console.log(“Under 0.5”);


false
0
“” (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN
