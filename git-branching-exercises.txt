Git Branching Exercise:

git branch <newBranchName>
git checkout -b <newBranchName>

fast forwards can only happen if there have not been commits on the original branch while the new branch is being worked on.

git checkout

Git branch -D <brachToBeDeletedName>

When Git can not determine what file or folder to choose when merging since there have been different commits with changes to the same file
