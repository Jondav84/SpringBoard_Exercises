Variables and Data types Exercise:

1.  let name = “Jonathan Sutton”;
    let dayOfBirth = 28;

2.  If you try to set 2 variables with the same name it will prioritize the first one.
    When you try to set the second one it will throw an error message.

3.  let faveColor = prompt(“what is your favorite color?”);
    console.log(“Your favorite color is “ + faveColor);

4.  let quote = ‘God said,  “Let there be light”’;
    let quote = `God said, “Let y’all have light”`;
    let quote = “How you doin’?”;
    let quote = "God said, \"Let there be light\"";
    let quote = ‘How you doin\’?’;

5.  Null is an intentionally set value of 0 or nothing, an established value of 0/nothing.
    Undefined is when a value does not exist/has not been established.

6.  NaN means not a number. Returned when you try to use a non numerical value in an equation. I.e. trying to add a string to a number in an equation w/o parseInt applied to the string.

7.  Yes you can declare the variable as (  let thing;  ). It will not be initiated with a value, so the value will return undefined.
